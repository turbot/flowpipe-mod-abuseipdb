## Getting started

### Installation

Download and install Flowpipe (https://flowpipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install flowpipe
```

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/flowpipe-mod-abuseipdb.git
cd flowpipe-mod-abuseipdb
```

### Usage

Start your server to get started:

```sh
flowpipe service start
```

Run a pipeline:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run check_ip
```

### Credentials

This mod uses the credentials configured in `flowpipe.pvars` or passed through `--pipeline-args api_key`.

### Configuration

Pipelines have [input variables](https://flowpipe.io/docs/using-flowpipe/mod-variables) that can be configured to better match your environment and requirements. Some variables have defaults defined in its source file, e.g., `variables.hcl`, but these can be overwritten in several ways:

- Copy and rename the `flowpipe.pvars.example` file to `flowpipe.pvars`, and then modify the variable values inside that file
- Pass in a value on the command line:

  ```shell
  flowpipe pipeline run check_ip --pipeline-arg api_key="bfc6f1c423b8b58xxxxxxxx9a85cda98f313c3d389126de0d" --pipeline-arg ip_address='127.0.0.1'
  ```

These are only some of the ways you can set variables. For a full list, please see [Passing Input Variables](https://flowpipe.io/docs/using-flowpipe/mod-variables#passing-input-variables).
